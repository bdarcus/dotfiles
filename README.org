In 2021, I finally decided to rationalize my dotfiles, which are currently pretty limited.

I want a gorgeous and functional shell and Emacs experience, that I can understand, and leaves me room to incrementally grow.

To wit, I use doom emacs, and my doom files are in a separate repo that predates this repo.

What is here, currently, then, is shell configurations for both =zsh= and =fish=; specifically:

1. The =zsh= version uses the =zinit= plugin manager (after earlier using prezto), with a "lean" prompt from the excellent =powerlevel10k= theme.
2. The =fish= version uses =fisher= and the =tide= theme, which is a port of =powerlevel10k=.

The configurations are /very/ similar functionally and visually.
But I spent /much/ more time on the =zsh= version than on the =fish=; hassling with details like environment variables, bugs, etc.
The =fish= version also involves much less code, that is simpler.

So it's looking like I'll focus on =fish= going forward.
I always have access to =bash= if I need it.
